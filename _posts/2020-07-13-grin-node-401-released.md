This release includesÂ a patch for a bug that was causing a thread panic. Details in the issue [mimblewimble/grin/#3386](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/3386) and the accompanying pull request [mimblewimble/grin/#3387](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/pull/3387).

The version 4.x family of releases include many improvements and fixes, and is required in order to interact with the network after the scheduled hard fork, currently estimated to occur on Jul 16 around 11 PM UTC. All users are encouraged to upgrade.
